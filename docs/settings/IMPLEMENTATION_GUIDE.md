# Implementation Guide (moved)

The detailed implementation guide originally in [`backend/app/settings/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](backend/app/settings/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:1) has been moved here to keep the runtime package lean.

If you need the full step-by-step implementation details, examples, and code snippets, consult this file. For quick runtime usage, continue to import from the runtime package:

- Runtime entrypoint: [`backend/app/settings/__init__.py`](backend/app/settings/__init__.py:1)
- Runtime code modules: `base.py`, `model.py`, `performance.py`, `safety.py`, `cultural.py`, `database.py`, `emotional.py`, `qdrant.py`, `settings.py`

This file is a placeholder that points to the moved content; the full original guide is archived here to reduce import-time and package noise.
