Try to stay connected with people who care about you, even in small ways. Send a message to a close friend, sit with your family at mealtime, or join a casual activity at school. Being around others you trust can remind you that you’re not alone, and it often brings small moments of comfort or even laughter. Feeling part of a community or friend group can reduce the loneliness that makes sadness worse. You don’t have to talk about your feelings every time – even simply hanging out can help. If you do feel like talking, choose someone you trust (a friend, sibling, mentor) and let them know you’re struggling. People who care about you usually want to help.

But you can be a lifeline (ubuzima bwabo bushobora gutabarwa n'ubufasha bwawe). Here's how you can help: First, talk to them. Find a private time and gently say what you've noticed: for example, \"You've been giving away your stuff and saying goodbye… I'm really worried about you\". Let them know you care and they're not alone. Listen patiently to what they share. Don't argue or say things like \"others have it worse.\" Instead, say, \"I'm here for you no matter what.\" Encourage them to get professional help. Suggest going together to the school counselor or a trusted teacher or calling a helpline. In Rwanda, you can help them call 8015, the 24/7 suicide prevention hotline. Important: Do not promise to keep their suicidal feelings secret. You might feel like you're betraying them, but telling a trusted adult can save their life. If they have a plan to hurt themselves soon, don't leave them alone – stay with them and seek emergency help immediately. You could literally save your friend's life by taking action. They might be upset at first that you told someone, but it's because you value their life.

The trouble is, avoiding activities makes you feel even worse. A helpful tip is to push yourself to do just one small enjoyable activity, even if you don’t really feel like it at first. It could be as simple as listening to your favorite music, kicking a football around, or texting a friend. These little actions can spark a bit of positive feeling or at least distract you from gloom for a while. Therapists call this approach behavioral activation – basically, doing before feeling. The idea is that by gently forcing yourself to get moving or engaged in something fun or meaningful, your mood can start to lift gradually. Remember, you don’t have to wait until you “feel like it” to do something small and positive. Doing the activity can create the good feeling, not the other way around."}, {"title": "Create a simple daily routine when feeling low", "bot_say": "Depression can make the day feel like an unstructured blur, which often makes you feel worse. Building a simple routine can give you a sense of purpose and small victories each day. Start with very basic goals – even things like getting out of bed by a certain time, taking a shower, and eating breakfast are important steps. For example, decide “I will get up by 7am and make my bed,” or “I’ll walk the dog at 4pm.” Writing down a gentle schedule (and including one thing you usually enjoy, like listening to music while you do homework) can help guide you through the day. Therapists find that making a routine with small, doable steps – like getting out of bed on time or texting one friend – can gradually improve mood and functioning. Each time you follow your plan, give yourself credit. A routine gives structure to your day so depression has less room to take over."}], "environment": "development", "model_name": "qwen2.5:7b", "temperature": 0.6, "rag_top_k": 3, "max_input_length": 2000, "crisis_keywords_count": 16}

It's important to know the signs when someone might be thinking about self-harm or suicide. Often, there are warning signs: Someone might talk about wanting to die or say they feel hopeless. They might withdraw from friends and family, or start giving away their belongings for no clear reason. Other red flags include major changes in behavior – not caring about personal appearance, sleeping or eating a lot less or more than usual, or showing constant sadness or irritability. You might also see posts on social media where the person sounds alone or really down. Self-harm (like cutting or burning skin) is also a serious sign of emotional pain, even if the person says they don't want to die; it shows they need help. If you notice any of these signs in a friend, take them seriously. Don't assume it's \"just for attention.\" Ask them gently, \"I've noticed you seem really down and said some worrying things. Do you want to talk or can I help?\" If you see these signs in yourself, please recognize it's a cry for help. You're not alone, and there are people who care and want to help you. Recognizing the signs is the first step to getting that help."}, {"title": "Finding Support in Youth Groups & Community", "bot_say": "Have you ever joined an itsinda (group) at school, church, or in your neighborhood? Being part of a youth group or club can do wonders for your mental well-being. When you're with others who share your interests or faith, you feel connected and understood. For example, church youth groups (itorero ry'urubyiruko) often feel like a second family – you might sing in a choir, play sports together, or discuss life challenges in a safe space. People lean on each other and pray or find solutions as a team. One young Rwandan in a self-help group said, \"When we are here in the group, we can support each other\". Community clubs (like debate teams, anti-GBV clubs, or sports teams) can give you purpose and friends who check on you. If you're feeling alone or troubled, look around for a group you could join: maybe a teen club at the health center, a dance group, or even an online community for youth (low bandwidth chats about mental health). The key is to surround yourself with positive people. Together, you share ideas, encourage each other, and notice if someone is not okay. That support can really lighten emotional burdens. Don't be afraid to show up and say \"mwiriwe\" (hello) – you might find a welcoming circle ready to include you."}, {"title": "Lean on Your Friends", "bot_say": "Good friends (inshuti nziza) are like medicine for the heart. Talking to a friend you trust can make you feel heard and less alone. Peer support – youths helping youths – is powerful: it reduces isolation, boosts confidence, and helps recovery through understanding and empathy. Friends might not be professional counselors, but they often understand what you're going through because they might have felt the same way. For example, studying together can ease stress if you both worry about exams, or sharing music and jokes can cheer you up on a bad day. If you're struggling, consider telling a close friend how you feel. You could say, \"I've been feeling anxious; can we talk?\" A true friend will listen and maybe share their own experiences so you know you're not the only one. Also, keep an eye on your friends. If you notice a friend withdrawing or always sad, reach out – even a simple \"Are you okay? I'm here for you\" can mean a lot. Helping each other builds a support system. As youth, sometimes we understand each other best. By being open and supportive, you and your peers can get through tough times together."}], "environment": "development", "model_name": "qwen2.5:7b", "temperature": 0.6, "rag_top_k": 3, "max_input_length": 2000, "crisis_keywords_count": 16}

You might also see posts on social media where the person sounds alone or really down. Self-harm (like cutting or burning skin) is also a serious sign of emotional pain, even if the person says they don't want to die; it shows they need help. If you notice any of these signs in a friend, take them seriously. Don't assume it's \"just for attention.\" Ask them gently, \"I've noticed you seem really down and said some worrying things.

Using food to comfort emotions – called emotional eating – is common. Maybe you find yourself finishing a whole pack of biscuits or a big Fanta when upset. Occasionally treating yourself is okay, but if it happens a lot, it can affect your health. Stress can trick us into thinking we're hungry when we're not. That bag of chips might feel good in the moment, but afterwards you might feel guilty or unwell. To break the cycle, first notice what you're feeling when you reach for food. Are you sad, bored, or angry? If you're not truly hungry (like your stomach isn't growling), try a different comfort: take a short walk, listen to music, or text a friend. Also, keep only a reasonable portion in front of you – put the rest away. This way, even if you snack, you won't overdo it. Remember, gufungura (eating) is fuel, not a therapy for feelings. Building other coping skills will help you feel in control. If emotional eating is making you upset or unhealthy, consider talking to a counselor or adult for support."}, {"title": "Finding Support in Youth Groups & Community", "bot_say": "Have you ever joined an itsinda (group) at school, church, or in your neighborhood? Being part of a youth group or club can do wonders for your mental well-being. When you're with others who share your interests or faith, you feel connected and understood. For example, church youth groups (itorero ry'urubyiruko) often feel like a second family – you might sing in a choir, play sports together, or discuss life challenges in a safe space. People lean on each other and pray or find solutions as a team. One young Rwandan in a self-help group said, \"When we are here in the group, we can support each other\". Community clubs (like debate teams, anti-GBV clubs, or sports teams) can give you purpose and friends who check on you. If you're feeling alone or troubled, look around for a group you could join: maybe a teen club at the health center, a dance group, or even an online community for youth (low bandwidth chats about mental health). The key is to surround yourself with positive people. Together, you share ideas, encourage each other, and notice if someone is not okay. That support can really lighten emotional burdens. Don't be afraid to show up and say \"mwiriwe\" (hello) – you might find a welcoming circle ready to include you."}, {"title": "Recognizing Warning Signs of Self-Harm or Suicide", "bot_say": "Your life matters. It's important to know the signs when someone might be thinking about self-harm or suicide. Often, there are warning signs: Someone might talk about wanting to die or say they feel hopeless. They might withdraw from friends and family, or start giving away their belongings for no clear reason. Other red flags include major changes in behavior – not caring about personal appearance, sleeping or eating a lot less or more than usual, or showing constant sadness or irritability. You might also see posts on social media where the person sounds alone or really down. Self-harm (like cutting or burning skin) is also a serious sign of emotional pain, even if the person says they don't want to die; it shows they need help. If you notice any of these signs in a friend, take them seriously. Don't assume it's \"just for attention.\" Ask them gently, \"I've noticed you seem really down and said some worrying things. Do you want to talk or can I help?\" If you see these signs in yourself, please recognize it's a cry for help. You're not alone, and there are people who care and want to help you. Recognizing the signs is the first step to getting that help."}, {"title": "Calming anxious thoughts with positive self-talk", "bot_say": "Anxiety often fills our heads with worst-case scenarios or harsh self-criticism. One way to fight back is with positive self-talk – basically, being your own supportive friend. Try gently replacing the negative thought with a kind, realistic statement. For example, if you catch yourself thinking, “I can’t handle this, I’ll fail,” pause and tell yourself instead, “I’ve prepared and I can get through this step by step.” It might feel odd at first, but positive affirmations do improve your mood and confidence over time. You can repeat them silently or out loud. The key is to use words that make you feel safe and capable, like “I am doing my best, and that’s enough” or “It’s OK to feel anxious, I will get through this.” Speaking to yourself as you would to a good friend – with encouragement and compassion – can banish some of those negative thoughts and help you feel calmer."}, {"title": "How to Help a Friend Who May Self-Harm", "bot_say": "It's scary when a friend says or does things that make you think they might hurt themselves.

Being around others you trust can remind you that you’re not alone, and it often brings small moments of comfort or even laughter. Feeling part of a community or friend group can reduce the loneliness that makes sadness worse. You don’t have to talk about your feelings every time – even simply hanging out can help. If you do feel like talking, choose someone you trust (a friend, sibling, mentor) and let them know you’re struggling. People who care about you usually want to help.

It could be as simple as listening to your favorite music, kicking a football around, or texting a friend. These little actions can spark a bit of positive feeling or at least distract you from gloom for a while. Therapists call this approach behavioral activation – basically, doing before feeling. The idea is that by gently forcing yourself to get moving or engaged in something fun or meaningful, your mood can start to lift gradually. Remember, you don’t have to wait until you “feel like it” to do something small and positive. Doing the activity can create the good feeling, not the other way around."}, {"title": "Create a simple daily routine when feeling low", "bot_say": "Depression can make the day feel like an unstructured blur, which often makes you feel worse. Building a simple routine can give you a sense of purpose and small victories each day.

For example, decide “I will get up by 7am and make my bed,” or “I’ll walk the dog at 4pm.” Writing down a gentle schedule (and including one thing you usually enjoy, like listening to music while you do homework) can help guide you through the day. Therapists find that making a routine with small, doable steps – like getting out of bed on time or texting one friend – can gradually improve mood and functioning. Each time you follow your plan, give yourself credit.

This exercise involves tensing and then releasing each muscle group one by one, from your feet all the way up to your head. By tightening and then relaxing your muscles in sequence, you can quiet your mind and signal your body to relax. The gentle cycle of flexing and releasing helps you notice the difference between tension and calm. As you breathe slowly, your body begins to feel heavy and at ease. Progressive muscle relaxation can make you sleepy by easing both physical and mental stress. It’s a simple way to help your whole body transition into rest mode."}, {"title": "Create a simple daily routine when feeling low", "bot_say": "Depression can make the day feel like an unstructured blur, which often makes you feel worse. Building a simple routine can give you a sense of purpose and small victories each day. Start with very basic goals – even things like getting out of bed by a certain time, taking a shower, and eating breakfast are important steps. For example, decide “I will get up by 7am and make my bed,” or “I’ll walk the dog at 4pm.” Writing down a gentle schedule (and including one thing you usually enjoy, like listening to music while you do homework) can help guide you through the day. Therapists find that making a routine with small, doable steps – like getting out of bed on time or texting one friend – can gradually improve mood and functioning. Each time you follow your plan, give yourself credit. A routine gives structure to your day so depression has less room to take over."}, {"title": "Doing small activities when you feel low", "bot_say": "When you feel low or numb, you might stop doing the things you used to enjoy.

It could be as simple as listening to your favorite music, kicking a football around, or texting a friend. These little actions can spark a bit of positive feeling or at least distract you from gloom for a while. Therapists call this approach behavioral activation – basically, doing before feeling. The idea is that by gently forcing yourself to get moving or engaged in something fun or meaningful, your mood can start to lift gradually. Remember, you don’t have to wait until you “feel like it” to do something small and positive.

Try to stay connected with people who care about you, even in small ways. Send a message to a close friend, sit with your family at mealtime, or join a casual activity at school. Being around others you trust can remind you that you’re not alone, and it often brings small moments of comfort or even laughter. Feeling part of a community or friend group can reduce the loneliness that makes sadness worse. You don’t have to talk about your feelings every time – even simply hanging out can help. If you do feel like talking, choose someone you trust (a friend, sibling, mentor) and let them know you’re struggling. People who care about you usually want to help.
